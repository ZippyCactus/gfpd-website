        "text": "This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Great Falls, South Carolina. Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1998 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1998 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. Chapter and Section Numbering System The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. Page Numbering System The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 &nbsp; Index The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. Looseleaf Supplements A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. Acknowledgments This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and Jean Lindsay, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Julie Blackwell, Town Clerk-Treasurer, for her cooperation and assistance, as well as other town officials, during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Defined terms are not capitalized when used in this article unless the context otherwise requires. Business means any business, calling, occupation, profession, or activity engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage, either directly or indirectly. Charitable organization means an organization that is determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from Federal income taxes under 26 U.S.C. Section 501(c)(3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (10) or (19). Charitable purpose means a benevolent, philanthropic, patriotic, or eleemosynary purpose that does not result in personal gain to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director, trustee, or person with ultimate control of the organization. Classification means that division of businesses by NAICS codes subject to the same license rate as determined by a calculated index of ability to pay based on national averages, benefits, equalization of tax burden, relationships of services, or other basis deemed appropriate by the council. Council means the Town Council of the Town of Great Falls. Domicile means a principal place from which the trade or business of a licensee is conducted, directed, or managed. For purposes of this article, a licensee may be deemed to have more than one domicile. Gross income means the gross receipts or gross revenue of a business, received or accrued, for one calendar or fiscal year collected or to be collected from business done within the municipality. If the licensee has a domicile within the municipality, business done within the municipality shall include all gross receipts or revenue received or accrued by such licensee. If the licensee does not have a domicile within the municipality, business done within the municipality shall include only gross receipts or revenue received or accrued within the municipality. In all cases, if the licensee pays a business license tax to another county or municipality, then the licensee's gross income for the purpose of computing the tax within the municipality must be reduced by the amount of revenues or receipts taxed in the other county or municipality and fully reported to the municipality. Gross income for business license tax purposes shall not include taxes collected for a governmental entity, escrow funds, or funds that are the property of a third party. The value of bartered goods or trade-in merchandise shall be included in gross income. The gross receipts or gross revenues for business license purposes may be verified by inspection of returns and reports filed with the Internal Revenue Service, the South Carolina Department of Revenue, the South Carolina Department of Insurance, or other government agencies. In calculating gross income for certain businesses, the following rules shall apply: (1) Gross income for agents shall be calculated on gross commissions received or retained, unless otherwise specified.

(c) The classifications included in each rate class are listed with NAICS codes, by sector, sub-sector, group, or industry. The business license class schedule (Appendix B) is a tool for classification and not a limitation on businesses subject to a business license tax. The classification in the most recent version of the business license class schedule adopted by the council that most specifically identifies the subject business shall be applied to the business. The license official shall have the authority to make the determination of the classification most specifically applicable to a subject business. (d) A copy of the class schedule and rate schedule shall be filed in the office of the municipal clerk. (Ord. of 12-20-2021(1))",

For nontitled vehicles, where the owner's name is known, a search must be conducted through the secretary of state's office to determine any lienholders. The application must be on prescribed forms as required by the appropriate titling facility or the secretary of state. If the vehicle has an out-of-state registration, an application must be made to that state's appropriate titling facility. When the vehicle is not titled in this state and does not have a registration from another state, the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop may apply to the chief of police for determination of the state where the vehicle is registered. The sheriff or chief of police shall conduct a records search.

The proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop may hold the license tag of any vehicle until all towing and storage costs have been paid, or if the vehicle is not reclaimed, until it is declared abandoned and sold. Storage costs may be charged that have accrued before the notification of the owner and lienholder, by certified or registered mail, of the location of the vehicle. Notification to the owner and lienholder by the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop must occur within five days after receiving the owner's and lienholders' identities from the appropriate law enforcement agency. If the notice is not mailed within this period, storage costs after the five-day period must not be charged until the notice is mailed. if the vehicle is not reclaimed within 30 days after the day the notice is mailed, return receipt requested, the vehicle is considered abandoned and may be sold by the magistrate pursuant to the procedures set forth in S.C. Code 1976, \u00a7 29-15-10. (7) After the vehicle is in the possession of the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop, the owner of the vehicle as demonstrated by providing a certificate of registration has one opportunity to remove from the vehicle any personal property not attached to the vehicle. The proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop must release any personal property that does not belong to the owner of the vehicle to the owner of the personal property. (8) If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided for in S.C. Code 1976, \u00a7 56-5-5630, the proprietor, owner, or operator of the towing company, storage facility, garage, or repair shop may have the abandoned vehicle sold at a public auction pursuant to the provisions set forth in S.C. Code 1976, \u00a7 29-15-10. The purchaser of the vehicle shall take title to it free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership, shall receive a magistrate's order of sale, and is entitled to register the purchased vehicle and receive a certificate of title. The order of sale given at the sale must be sufficient title for purposes of transferring the vehicle to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking, or dismantling, and in this case no further titling of the vehicle is necessary. The expenses of the auction, the costs of towing, preserving, and storing the vehicle which resulted from placing the vehicle in custody, and all notice and publication costs incurred pursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code 1976, \u00a7 29-15-10, must be reimbursed up to the amount of the auction sale price from the sale proceeds of the vehicle. Any remainder of the sale proceeds must be held for the owner of the vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days. The magistrate must notify the owner and all lienholders by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, that the vehicle owner or lienholder has 90 days to claim the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle. If the vehicle proceeds are not collected within 90 days from the day after the notice to the owner and all lienholders is mailed, then the vehicle proceeds must be deposited in the general fund of the county or municipality.

(b) There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: (1) For residential and commercial service; and (2) For service to establishments producing industrial wastes. (c) In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the town. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent. The currently required permit and inspection fee for a residential, commercial or industrial building sewer permit shall be paid to the town at the time the application is filed. (d) All cost and expense incident to the connection of the building sewer from the owner's building to the town property line shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the town from any loss or damage that may be directly or indirectly occasioned by the connection of the building sewer. Any connection from the town property line into the public sewer shall be made by the town, for which the owner shall pay the town a standard sewer tap fee as stated in section 42-29. (e) A separate and independent sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. (f) Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings when they are found, on examination and test by the superintendent, to meet all requirements of this article. (g) The building sewer shall be cast iron pipe, ASTM specification A74; vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM specifications C13; or concrete sewer pipe, ASTM specification C14; PVC or polyvinyl chloride ASTM D-2661. Joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe with leaded joints. Cast iron pipe with leaded joints may be required by the superintendent where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable grounds, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that nonmetallic material may be accepted if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the superintendent. (h) The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. (i) Whenever possible the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fittings. (j) In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. (k) All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification C12; except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected. (l) All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp and filled with molten lead, Federal Specification QQL-156, not less than one inch deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and caulked tight. No paint, varnish or other coatings shall be permitted on the joint material until after the joint has been tested and approved. Rubber joint cast iron pipe may be used as an alternate. All joints in vitrified clay or concrete pipe or between such pipe and metals shall be made with approved hot pouring jointing material, as specified below or by using rubber gaskets or preformed factory-applied couplings having resilient properties in accordance with ASTM specification C443-59T for concrete pipe and ASTM specification C425-64 for vitrified clay pipe, or the latest revisions thereof. Material for hot poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit, nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage system. The joint shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp or similar approved material. Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval of the superintendent. (m) The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the Y-branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located Y-branch is available, the town shall install a Y-branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the superintendent. Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located Y is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent. (n) The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. (o) All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the town. (Code 1981, \u00a7 50.06; Code 1998, \u00a7 42-36)",
